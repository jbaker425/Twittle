This is a mock Twitter app name "Twittle". Users can make accounts and sign in and out. They can post edit and delete tweets. Some features are not quite as complete as Twitter, but this was merely a good practice project for Ruby on Rails. The idea was inspired by The Odin Project website's course in Ruby on Rails regarding Authorization. Members of this course were directed to a small video series on Youtube, following instructions from the channel Web-Crunch. He guides the views through the ideas of how to combine Ruby on Rails fundamentals with other Ruby gems to make a great, almost Twitter-like application. Of course, there were some liberties taken on my end that I thought made the application more personal, but he did a great job of styling the site to look very proffessional.
